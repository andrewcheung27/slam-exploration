## SLAM Simulator

### Instructions
1. Click "Start Simulation".
2. Use WASD to move around, Space to go up, and Shift to go down. Use J and L to turn left and right, and I and K to look up and down. Press P to stabilize. Press E multiple times to make observations, which add nodes to the pose graph (in the future, we will make observations automatically).
3. Click "Stop Simulation" in the top left corner. White dots will appear to represent pose graph nodes with simulated error, and magenta dots will appear to show the ground truth trajectory. Particles will appear to display the point cloud map. You can move around with the same controls.
4. Click "Restart Simulation" to do it again.
